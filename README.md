# Fizz Buzz Plus Plus

Fizz Buzz is a game about division. For a complete explanation see the [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz). But the basic gist is that if a number is divisible by 3 it should be replaced by "fizz". A number divisible by 5 should be replaced by "buzz". A number divisible by 3 and 5 should be replaced by "fizzbuzz". All other numbers should be left as is.

The basic version of Fizz Buzz is great to get started. But sometimes it's fun to solve a problem a little more complex. The following is a list of additional conditions to make the basic Fizz Buzz problem a bit more complex. The main cases are marked in **bold**. There are some examples of combinations of different multiples in normal text.
