# Notes for presenters

The basic Fizz Buzz problem is a fairly simple one. As such it is a great candidate for participants who are less experienced with coding. It can also be a great candidate for participants who are more familiar with coding but are less familiar with TDD. The basic problem can be implemented using pretty strict TDD. The basic problem can also be done individually, as pairs, or in a group/Randori style depending on the audience.

## The extended problem

For those more familiar with coding and especially those more familiar with coding _and_ TDD the basic Fizz Buzz problem will likely be trivially simple to implement. In that case feel free to introduce the extended version of the problem. If the participants are already familiar with the problem it may be appropriate to share the entire table from the main [README.md](../README.md) file with them at once. Otherwise it may be more appropriate to share each new primary case with them one at a time. Make sure the participants understand that each new case introduced needs to also be incorporated with all previous cases already implemented.

## Challenges while presenting

For very inexperienced participants, problems around language syntax, development environment and testing framework are likely. More experienced participants will likely finish the intial problem quite quickly. The extended version should help with that. If the audience is a mix of less experienced and more experienced participants it's possible that some people will get stuck on language or environment issues while others are bored waiting for additional cases. Asking about experience levels with coding and TDD and pairing more experienced participants with less experienced participants at the beginning of the exercise can help with mitigate that.

## Learning objectives

This kata is great to use when introducing people to TDD and/or pairing. There may be some potentially interesting refactorings as the number of cases introduced increases.
